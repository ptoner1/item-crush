<h1>Item Crush</h1>
<p>
   This is a Candy Crush clone using React.  It's called Item Crush because we allow the user to change their game pieces from candies to animals. 
   It is currently deployed at http://itemcrush-paultoner.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

<h2>Improvement Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
   <li>
    Top row of gameBoard is hit or miss with the animateDown property.
    -> Possible solution would be to add a new row on top of the gameboard loaded
    with random items, invisible and ready to go.  New items would be created into the
    invisible row.
   </li>
   <li>
    Need a function for checking 5-in-a-row, and a new piece that results from it.
   </li>
<ul>
