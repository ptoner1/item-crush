<h1>Item Crush</h1>
<p>
   This is a Candy Crush clone using React.  It's called Item Crush because we allow the user to change their game pieces from candies to animals. 
   It is currently deployed

<h2>Improvement Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
   <li>
      Top row of gameBoard is hit or miss with the animateDown property.
      -> Possible solution would be to add a new row on top of the gameboard loaded
      with random items, invisible and ready to go.  New items would be created into the
      invisible row.
   </li>
   <li>
      Could use a function for checking 5-in-a-row, and a new piece that results from it.
   </li>
   <li>
      Could save different high scores for different board sizes.
   </li>
<ul>
