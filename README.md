BUGS:

1. Top row of gameBoard is hit or miss with the animateDown property.
    -> Possible solution would be to add a new row on top of the gameboard loaded
    with random items, invisible and ready to go.  New items would be created into the
    invisible row.

2. Need a function for checking 5-in-a-row, and a new piece that results from it.
